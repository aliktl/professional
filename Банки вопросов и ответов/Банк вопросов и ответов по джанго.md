1. **What is Django, and what are its key features?**

   Answer №1: Django is a high-level web framework for Python that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It is known for its batteries-included approach, providing a rich set of features out of the box. Key features of Django include its powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interactions, URL routing, template engine, authentication system, and administration interface.

2. **What is Flask, and how does it differ from Django?**

   Answer №1: Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python. It takes a minimalist approach, providing essential components for web development without enforcing strict architectural patterns like Django. Flask allows developers to have more freedom and flexibility in designing their application structure and choosing additional libraries or tools. It is often favored for smaller projects or when more fine-grained control is required.
