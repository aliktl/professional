1. **What is Inheritance in Python?**

   Answer №1: Inheritance is the ability of one class to inherit all the attributes and methods of another class. So, it enables the reusability of code.
   
   Moreover, the class that got inherited is called the super class or parent class. Meanwhile, the class that inherits the parent class attributes is called a derived or child class.  
   
2. **What is Polymorphism in Python?**

   Answer №1: Polymorphism is one of the fundamental concepts in OOPs. It refers to the ability of an attribute to take multiple forms.  
   
   In Python, the term is used to categorize attributes of the same name but with different features. For instance, if the parent class has a method called ABC, the child can also use the same method with the same name but different variables and parameters.

3. **What is Encapsulation in Python?**

   Answer №1: Encapsulation is an important concept of OOPs. It is defined as the process of combining data and methods to form one unit.  
   
   Class is one of the best examples of encapsulation. It wraps all data with similar features and characteristics into one category. 

4. **What is inheritance? Name the main types of Python inheritance.**

   Answer №1: Inheritance is a way for a class to pass its members (e.g. methods or attributes) to a new class. In this case, a class that contains the original data is called a super-class. The inheriting class is called a child or derived class. 

   There are four inheritance types in Python:
   
   - Single inheritance – a child class inherits the data passed down by one super-class.
   - Multiple inheritance – a child class inherits the members of several super-classes.
   - Multi-level inheritance – a derived class d1 inherits the members of a super-class b1; a child class d2 inherits the data from a base class b2.
   - Hierarchical inheritance – a high number of child classes can inherit the members of one superclass
