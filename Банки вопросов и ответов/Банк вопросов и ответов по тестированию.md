# Банк вопросов и ответов по тестированию

1. **What is unit testing, and how is it implemented in Python?**

   Answer №1: Unit testing is a software testing practice that involves testing individual units or components of code to ensure their correctness and functionality. In Python, unit testing can be implemented using the built-in **unittest** module, which provides a framework for writing and executing tests. Alternatively, developers often use popular third-party testing frameworks like **pytest** for more concise and flexible testing.

2. **What is test-driven development (TDD), and how does it work in Python?**

   Answer №1: Test-driven development (TDD) is a development approach where tests are written before writing the actual code. The process typically involves writing a failing test, implementing the code to pass the test, and then refactoring and iterating on the process. TDD promotes code quality, test coverage, and helps ensure that the code meets the specified requirements.
