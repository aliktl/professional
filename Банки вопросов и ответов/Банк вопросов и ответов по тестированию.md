# Банк вопросов и ответов по тестированию

1. **What is Pytest, and why do we use it?**

    Answer №1: Pytest is a well-liked Python testing framework that makes it easier for programmers to create and execute unit tests. It provides better reporting, a clearer syntax, and is simpler to discover tests than the built-in unittest module. Pytest is used to test code before it is put into production to make sure it works as planned and to identify any errors or weaknesses.
    
2. **What is a test fixture in Pytest?**

    Answer №1: A test fixture performs the setup and breakdown tasks required for a test. Fixtures are reusable resources that can be provided in Pytest and are defined using the @pytest.fixture decorator.

3. **How do you run a test with Pytest?**

    Answer №1: To run a test with Pytest, use the Pytest command followed by the name of the test file or directory. For example, to run all tests in the current directory, use Pytest. To run a specific test, use Pytest path/to/test_file.py::test_name.

4. **What is an assertion in Pytest, and how do you use it?**

    Answer №1: A statement that tests if a condition is true is called an assertion. Using the assert keyword and the condition to be checked, assertions are made in Pytest. As an illustration, use the statement assert my_function() == expected_value to determine whether a function's output equals a particular value.

5. **What is the difference between assert and assert not in Pytest?**

    Answer №1: assert is used to check whether a condition is true, while assert not is used to check whether a condition is false. For example, assert my_function() == expected_valuechecks whether my_function() returns the expected value, while assert not my_function() checks whether my_function() returns a value that is not true.

6. **What is the Pytest.ini file, and what is its purpose?**

    Answer №1: You can modify how Pytest behaves by using the pytest.ini configuration file. It can be used to configure settings for things like test discovery, test execution, and reporting.

7. **How do you write a test case in Pytest?**

    Answer №1: In order to create a test case in Pytest, define a function that begins with test_ and use the assert keyword to verify that the function being tested produces the desired outcome. For example:
    ```python
    def test_addition():
        assert 1 + 1 == 2
    ```
    
8. **What is a test suite in Pytest?**

    Answer №1: A test suite in Pytest is a collection of test functions that are run together. Test suites are created by organizing test functions into test files or directories.

9. **How do you skip a test in Pytest?**

    Answer №1: Use the pytest.skip() function inside the test function to skip a test in Pytest. For example:
    ```python
    def test_functionality():
        if not some_condition:
            pytest.skip("Some condition not met")
        assert my_function() == expected_value
    ```
    
10. **How do you parametrize a test in Pytest?**

    Answer №1: To parametrize a test in Pytest, use the @pytest.mark.parametrize decorator. For example:
    ```python
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("input, expected", [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)])
    def test_increment(input, expected):
        assert input + 1 == expected
    ```

19. **What is unit testing, and how is it implemented in Python?**

   Answer №1: Unit testing is a software testing practice that involves testing individual units or components of code to ensure their correctness and functionality. In Python, unit testing can be implemented using the built-in **unittest** module, which provides a framework for writing and executing tests. Alternatively, developers often use popular third-party testing frameworks like **pytest** for more concise and flexible testing.

20. **What is test-driven development (TDD), and how does it work in Python?**

   Answer №1: Test-driven development (TDD) is a development approach where tests are written before writing the actual code. The process typically involves writing a failing test, implementing the code to pass the test, and then refactoring and iterating on the process. TDD promotes code quality, test coverage, and helps ensure that the code meets the specified requirements.
