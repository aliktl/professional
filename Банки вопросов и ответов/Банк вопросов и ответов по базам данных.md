1. **What is SQL?**

   Answer №1: The acronym SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the typical language used for relational database maintenance and a wide range of data processing tasks. The first SQL database was created in 1970. It is a database language used for operations such as database creation, deletion, retrieval, and row modification. It is occasionally pronounced “sequel.” It can also be used to manage structured data, which is made up of variables called entities and relationships between those entities.

2. **How to create a table in SQL?**

   Answer №1: The command to create a table in SQL is extremely simple:

   ``` sql
    CREATE TABLE table_name (
  	column1 datatype,
  	column2 datatype,
  	column3 datatype,
     ....
    );
   ```
   We will start off by giving the keywords, CREATE TABLE, and then we will give the name of the table. After that in braces, we will list out all the columns along with their data types.

   For example, if we want to create a simple employee table:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employee (
	 name varchar(25),
	 age int,
	 gender varchar(25),
   ....
   );
   ```

3. **How to delete a table in SQL?**

   Answer №1: There are two ways to delete a table from SQL: DROP and TRUNCATE. The DROP TABLE command is used to completely delete the table from the database. This is the command:

   ```sql
   DROP TABLE table_name;
   ```
   The above command will completely delete all the data present in the table along with the table itself.
  
   But if we want to delete only the data present in the table but not the table itself, then we will use the truncate command:

   ```sql
   TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
   ```
4. **How to change a table name in SQL?**

   Answer №1: This is the command to change a table name in SQL:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE table_name
   RENAME TO new_table_name;
   ```
   We will start off by giving the keywords ALTER TABLE, then we will follow it up by giving the original name of the table, after that, we will give in the keywords RENAME TO and finally, we will give the new table name.

   For example, if we want to change the “employee” table to “employee_information”, this will be the command:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE employee
   RENAME TO employee_information;
   ```

5. **How to delete a row in SQL?**

   Answer №1: We will be using the DELETE query to delete existing rows from the table:

   ```sql 
   DELETE FROM table_name
   WHERE [condition];
   ```

   We will start off by giving the keywords DELETE FROM, then we will give the name of the table, and after that we will give the WHERE clause and give the condition on the basis of which we would want to delete a row.

   For example, from the employee table, if we would like to delete all the rows, where the age of the employee is equal to 25, then this will be the command:

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM employee
   WHERE [age=25];
   ```

6. **How to create a database in SQL?**

   Answer №1: A database is a repository in SQL, which can comprise multiple tables.

   This will be the command to create a database in sql:
   ```sql	
   CREATE DATABASE database_name.
   ```

7. **What is Normalization in SQL?**

   Answer №1: Normalization is used to decompose a larger, complex table into simple and smaller ones. This helps us in removing all the redundant data.

   Generally, in a table, we will have a lot of redundant information which is not required, so it is better to divide this complex table into multiple smaller tables which contain only unique information.

   **First normal form:**
   A relation schema is in 1NF, if and only if:

   - All attributes in the relation are atomic(indivisible value)
   - And there are no repeating elements or groups of elements.

   **Second normal form:**
   A relation is said to be in 2NF, if and only if:

   - It is in 1st Normal Form.
   - No partial dependency exists between non-key attributes and key attributes.
   
   **Third Normal form:**

   A relation R is said to be in 3NF if and only if:

   - It is in 2NF.
   - No transitive dependency exists between non-key attributes and key attributes through another non-key attribute


8. **What is join in SQL?**

   Answer №1: Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

   Types of Joins:

   • **INNER JOIN** − Returns rows when there is a match in both tables.

   • **LEFT JOIN** − Returns all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table.

   • **RIGHT JOIN** − Returns all rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table.

   • **FULL OUTER JOIN** − Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables.

   • **SELF JOIN** − Used to join a table to itself as if the table were two tables, temporarily renaming at least one table in the SQL statement.

   • **CARTESIAN JOIN** (CROSS JOIN) − Returns the Cartesian product of the sets of records from the two or more joined tables.

   **INNER JOIN:**
   The INNER JOIN creates a new result table by combining column values of two tables (table1 and table2) based upon the join-predicate. The query compares each row of table1 with each row of table2 to find all pairs of rows which satisfy the join-predicate.

   **SYNTAX:**
   ```sql
   SELECT table1.col1, table2.col2,…, table1.coln
   FROM table1
   INNER JOIN table2
   ON table1.commonfield = table2.commonfield;
   ```
   **LEFT JOIN:**

   The LEFT JOIN returns all the values from the left table, plus matched values from the right table or NULL in case of no matching join predicate.

   **SYNTAX:**
   ```sql
   SELECT table1.col1, table2.col2,…, table1.coln
   FROM table1
   LEFT JOIN table2
   ON table1.commonfield = table2.commonfield;
   ```

   **RIGHT JOIN:**

   The RIGHT JOIN returns all the values from the right table, plus matched values from the left table or NULL in case of no matching join predicate.

   **SYNTAX:**
   ```sql
   SELECT table1.col1, table2.col2,…, table1.coln
   FROM table1
   RIGHT JOIN table2
   ON table1.commonfield = table2.commonfield;
   ```
   
   **FULL OUTER JOIN:**

   The FULL OUTER JOIN combines the results of both left and right outer joins. The joined table will contain all records from both the tables and fill in NULLs for missing matches on either side.

   **SYNTAX:**
   ```sql
   SELECT table1.col1, table2.col2,…, table1.coln
   FROM table1
   Left JOIN table2
   ON table1.commonfield = table2.commonfield;
   Union
   SELECT table1.col1, table2.col2,…, table1.coln
   FROM table1
   Right JOIN table2
   ON table1.commonfield = table2.commonfield;
   ```
   
   **SELF JOIN:**

   The SELF JOIN joins a table to itself; temporarily renaming at least one table in the SQL statement.

   **SYNTAX:**
   ```sql
   SELECT a.col1, b.col2,..., a.coln
   FROM table1 a, table1 b
   WHERE a.commonfield = b.commonfield;
   ```
