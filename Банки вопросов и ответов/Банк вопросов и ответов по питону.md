2. **What can be the keys of a dictionary in Python?**

   Answer №1: When answering this interview question, a junior Python developer candidate may answer None, strings, or numbers. A mid-level developer may mention booleans, tuples, or any immutable object. However, a senior Python developer is expected to answer that any hashable object can be the key of a dictionary.

   Any hashable object is immutable. As an example, the code below is correct as this tuple and all of its elements are hashable. Please be aware that sets, dictionaries, and lists are not hashable, therefore cannot be the keys of a dictionary. 

   ```python 
      my_d = {
             (12, "job", (1, 2, 3)): 123
         }
   ```
