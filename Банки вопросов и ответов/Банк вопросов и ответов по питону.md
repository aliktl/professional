1. **What are the types of operators in Python?**

   Answer №1: Python divides the operators in the following groups:
    1. Arithmetic operators
    2. Assignment operators
    3. Comparison operators
    4. Logical operators
    5. Identity operators
    6. Membership operators
    7. Bitwise operators

2. **What can be the keys of a dictionary in Python?**

   Answer №1: When answering this interview question, a junior Python developer candidate may answer None, strings, or numbers. A mid-level developer may mention booleans, tuples, or any immutable object. However, a senior Python developer is expected to answer that any hashable object can be the key of a dictionary.

   Any hashable object is immutable. As an example, the code below is correct as this tuple and all of its elements are hashable. Please be aware that sets, dictionaries, and lists are not hashable, therefore cannot be the keys of a dictionary. 

   ```python 
      my_d = {
             (12, "job", (1, 2, 3)): 123
         }
   ```
   
   

3. **What are the usages of nonlocal and global keywords in Python?**
     
   Answer №1: 
   ```python 
      variable = "hello 1" # This variable is declared in the Global scope

      def fun():
          global variable # Without this we would not be able to change the variable value
          variable = "hello 2"
          
      fun()
      print(variable) # "hello 2"
      ………………………………………………………………..
      def outer():
          variable = "hello 1" # This variable is declared in a Local scope
          
          def inner():
              nonlocal variable # Without this keyword we could not change the variable value
              variable = "hello 2"
          
          inner()
          print(variable)
          
      outer() # "hello 2"
   ```

10. **What is GIL and why is it important?**

    Answer №1: GIL is one of the most controversial and important features of the CPython-based implementation of Python. GIL, or Global Interpreter Lock, is a construct/tool that makes sure that only one thread at a time can execute a Python program. In other words, this lock belongs to the Python interpreter and it uses it to lock a thread.

    For example, thread T1 acquires GIL and does its job. While the Python interpreter is using GIL to lock T1, all other threads have to wait. After T1 finishes, it releases GIL and passes it to another thread T2 that needs it. The reason for the GIL presence is to make CPython thread-safe and not allow some threads to interfere with one another.
