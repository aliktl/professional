1. **What are the types of operators in Python?**

   Answer №1: Python divides the operators in the following groups:
    1. Arithmetic operators
    2. Assignment operators
    3. Comparison operators
    4. Logical operators
    5. Identity operators
    6. Membership operators
    7. Bitwise operators

2. **What can be the keys of a dictionary in Python?**

   Answer №1: When answering this interview question, a junior Python developer candidate may answer None, strings, or numbers. A mid-level developer may mention booleans, tuples, or any immutable object. However, a senior Python developer is expected to answer that any hashable object can be the key of a dictionary.

   Any hashable object is immutable. As an example, the code below is correct as this tuple and all of its elements are hashable. Please be aware that sets, dictionaries, and lists are not hashable, therefore cannot be the keys of a dictionary. 

   ```python 
      my_d = {
             (12, "job", (1, 2, 3)): 123
         }
   ```

3. **What are the usages of nonlocal and global keywords in Python?**
     
   Answer №1: 
   ```python 
      variable = "hello 1" # This variable is declared in the Global scope

      def fun():
          global variable # Without this we would not be able to change the variable value
          variable = "hello 2"
          
      fun()
      print(variable) # "hello 2"
      ………………………………………………………………..
      def outer():
          variable = "hello 1" # This variable is declared in a Local scope
          
          def inner():
              nonlocal variable # Without this keyword we could not change the variable value
              variable = "hello 2"
          
          inner()
          print(variable)
          
      outer() # "hello 2"
   ```

4. **What is GIL and why is it important?**

    Answer №1: GIL is one of the most controversial and important features of the CPython-based implementation of Python. GIL, or Global Interpreter Lock, is a construct/tool that makes sure that only one thread at a time can execute a Python program. In other words, this lock belongs to the Python interpreter and it uses it to lock a thread.

    For example, thread T1 acquires GIL and does its job. While the Python interpreter is using GIL to lock T1, all other threads have to wait. After T1 finishes, it releases GIL and passes it to another thread T2 that needs it. The reason for the GIL presence is to make CPython thread-safe and not allow some threads to interfere with one another.

5. **WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT DATA TYPES IN PYTHON?**
    
    Answer №1: Python supports several built-in data types, including None, numeric (integers, floats, and complex numbers), Boolean, sequence (lists, tuples, and ranges), binary (bytes and bytearrays), string (unicode and byte strings), mapping (dictionaries), set types (sets and frozensets), callables (functions, methods, and classes), and modules. Understanding these data types is crucial for effective programming in Python.

6. **What is Inheritance in Python?**

   Answer №1: Inheritance is the ability of one class to inherit all the attributes and methods of another class. So, it enables the reusability of code.
   
   Moreover, the class that got inherited is called the super class or parent class. Meanwhile, the class that inherits the parent class attributes is called a derived or child class.  
   
7. **What is Polymorphism in Python?**

   Answer №1: Polymorphism is one of the fundamental concepts in OOPs. It refers to the ability of an attribute to take multiple forms.  
   
   In Python, the term is used to categorize attributes of the same name but with different features. For instance, if the parent class has a method called ABC, the child can also use the same method with the same name but different variables and parameters.

8. **What is Encapsulation in Python?**

   Answer №1: Encapsulation is an important concept of OOPs. It is defined as the process of combining data and methods to form one unit.  
   
   Class is one of the best examples of encapsulation. It wraps all data with similar features and characteristics into one category.
